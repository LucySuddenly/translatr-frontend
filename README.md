# Translatr - Frontend

This is the frontend for the [Translatr website](https://yongliang24.github.io/translatr-frontend/). Translatr is a single-page app where you can get a translation for a word or phrase and save it to a trip -- the trip acts as a kind of phrasebook. You can also get international currency conversions.

It uses a backend, which can be found [here](https://github.com/LucySuddenly/translatr-backend).

## Motivation

We wanted to use a Google API, and the translate API seemed like a great fit for a project.
